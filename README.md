# Introduction

Hi! My name is Sang Putu and this is the repository of my personal project: **Exploratory Data Analysis using Kaggle Dataset**.


# About this project

This project is about demonstrating simple ways to handle and process raw dataset using python, dataframe operations, and visualizations.

## Source

The project's main .csv file is called **marketing_data.csv** and you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data). It is a marketing analytics exploratory practice dataset, provided by **Jack Daoud**.

## Libraries Used
This project uses libraries for processing our dataset, such as:

 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) for linear algebra
 - [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) Data processing
 - [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) Plotting library
 - [Seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/) Plotting library (better visualizations)
 - [Plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/) Plotting library
 - OS File navigation (to access csv, by default is already installed)
